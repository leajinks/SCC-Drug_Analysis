# SCC-Drug_Analysis

The effect of ten different drug regimens on the tumor size of mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
was studied in a population for 248 male and female mice. Each mouse was administered a different drug while 
their body weights and tumor volumes were measured over a period of time. In this analysis, the primary goal is 
to identify any correlations between drug regimen, mouse weight, and tumor size.

The calculations requested for this analysis focus on the final tumor volume of each mouse for four specific drug 
regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin). Capomulin and Ramicane have significantly lower final tumor 
volumes than Infubinol and Ceftamin, however since there is no analysis of the tumor growth over time (i.e. difference 
between final tumor volume and starting tumor volume), we can't use this data to conclude that Capomulin and Ramicane 
are more effective at slowing tumor growth.

We also compare average tumor volume to the weight of its respective mouse, and find a strong correlation between higher 
mouse weight and larger tumor volume. More data about the drug regimens is required to know if higher drug dosing would be 
more effective on heavier mice, or if drug efficacy reduces as mouse weight increases regardless of dosing.

Although this analysis provides limited insight into this study, we can be confident in the consistency and accuracy of 
this data as there is only one outlier in the measured data points. Other opportunities for further analysis include 
comparing drug efficacy to mice of different ages and sexes, as these are important considerations when providing drug 
type and dosing recommendations.
